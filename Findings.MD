# Invariants

Can never withdraw more than deposited

Can never revert


# QA - To Monitor

If people end up depositing via donation
-> Add sweep via upgrade

If people end up forgetting to withdraw
-> Add a way to withdraw for them only once 100% of the program has expired

I would add these via upgrade only if necessary
